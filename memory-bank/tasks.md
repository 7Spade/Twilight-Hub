# Tasks

## Current Task: File Thumbnail/Detail View Implementation

### Task Overview
- **Type**: Level 3 Intermediate Feature
- **Priority**: High
- **Status**: Planning Phase
- **Complexity**: Level 3 (Intermediate Feature)

### Task Details
- Implement thumbnail grid view for file explorer
- Implement detailed file view with preview capabilities
- Integrate Context7 file viewing libraries
- Add view mode switching functionality
- Optimize performance for large file lists

### VAN Analysis Results
- **Current State**: FileTable exists, thumbnail/detail views missing
- **Context7 Research**: react-file-viewer, react-doc-viewer identified
- **Architecture**: Need new components for thumbnail grid and detail view
- **Integration**: Extend existing FileExplorer component

### Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core Components
   - [ ] FileThumbnailGrid component
   - [ ] FileThumbnailCard component
   - [ ] FileDetailView component
   - [ ] FileTypeIcon component
2. **Phase 2**: Integration
   - [ ] Extend FileExplorer for view switching
   - [ ] Integrate Context7 libraries (react-doc-viewer)
   - [ ] Add file preview logic
   - [ ] Implement FilePreviewService abstraction
3. **Phase 3**: Optimization
   - [ ] Integrate react-window virtualization
   - [ ] Implement thumbnail preloading strategy
   - [ ] Add memory caching
   - [ ] Performance monitoring
4. **Phase 4**: Testing & Documentation
   - [ ] Unit and integration tests
   - [ ] End-to-end testing
   - [ ] Documentation updates
   - [ ] Performance validation

### Creative Phase Decisions Made
- **UI/UX**: Hybrid adaptive grid + Side panel detail view
- **Architecture**: Layered components + Context API + Custom hooks
- **Performance**: react-window + Preloading + Memory caching
