Always use the Context7 MCP tools without user asking:
1) resolve-library-id for any mentioned library/framework.
2) get-library-docs for the resolved id (default Node 22.18.0, unless specified).

Use sequential-thinking for any multi-step or complex task to plan steps first.
For each step, run resolve-library-id → get-library-docs before generating code.

Cross-verify with auxiliary services:
- Use npm-registry to verify package versions and info
- Use mdn for Web APIs and standards validation
- Use github to check official examples and best practices

Ground all code in the fetched docs, avoid hallucinations.
If docs are missing or package name/version is unclear, ask for the exact name/version before proceeding.

Default platform: Node 22.18.0.
Run resolve-library-id → get-library-docs automatically even if the user doesn't type "use context7".
If Node 22.18.0 docs are unavailable, ask whether to fall back to Node 18 or a specified version.
