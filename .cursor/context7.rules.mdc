[rule]
- Always ground code in Context7 docs (Node 22.18.0 by default).
- If docs missing, ask for exact lib@version, or propose fallback (Node 18).
- For multi-step tasks, first call sequentialthinking to outline steps, then for each step call Context7.

[flow]
1) sequentialthinking (if task spans multiple steps)
2) resolve-library-id
3) get-library-docs
4) Cross-verify with npm-registry/mdn/github
5) implement minimal solution with:
   - library@version references
   - short citations (doc page or section)
   - clear limitations or TODOs

[error]
- If docs fetch fails: report reason, ask for package name/version or confirm fallback.
- If auxiliary services fail: continue with Context7 results, note limitations.[rule]
